Except as otherwise provided by nonwaivable, nondisclaimable applicable Law or the express provisions of this Agreement, we will not be liable for any losses or damages caused by: (a) your misconduct, errors or negligence, including your failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement; (b) an act or failure to act of any person not directly within our control; (c) unauthorized access of your Account or Bitcoin Wallet or your failure to report such unauthorized access promptly to us; or (d) your use or misuse of our Services.</dt><br>
<dt><b>12.6.</b> <u>WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS</u>. You understand and agree that your use of the Service is at your own sole risk.</dt><br>
<dt>WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE 'AS IS' AND WITHOUT WARRANTY BY US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, MARKETERS ADVERTISERS OR SUPPLIERS (THE 'OTHER ENTITIES'), AS APPLICABLE, AND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND THE OTHER ENTITIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THERE IS NO WARRANTY, WHETHER BY US OR THE OTHER ENTITIES, THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT YOUR ACCESS TO THE SAME WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR WITH RESPECT TO PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY CAPABILITY, CURRENTNESS OR OTHERWISE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY ANY PERSON SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER RELATING TO US OR THE OTHER ENTITIES, AS APPLICABLE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR THE OTHER ENTITIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT.</dt><br>
<dt>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR THE OTHER ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF YOUR INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MARKETING OR PURCHASE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT, EVEN IF WE OR THE OTHER ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</dt><br>
<dt>BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT IN A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE ANY DISCLAIMER OR LIMITATION ON DAMAGES OR LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN IS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THEN WE AND THE OTHER ENTITIES WILL BE ENTITLED TO THE MAXIMUM DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES AND LIABILITY AVAILABLE AT LAW OR IN EQUITY AND IN NO EVENT WILL THOSE DAMAGES OR LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100.</dt><br>
</dl>
<li>INDEMNIFICATION</li>
<dl>
<dt>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us and the Other Entities, in their individual capacities or otherwise, from and against any third party claims, liability, damages or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from (a) your negligence; (b) any claim by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) alleging that your use of our Services violates the rights of any third party, or violates any Law; (c) your failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement; (d) your violation of any applicable Law; (e) your violation of any rights of a third party; or (f) your use of our Services.</dt><br>
</dl>
<li>EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL</li>
<dl>
<dt><b>14.1.</b> <u>Definition</u>. An “Event Outside Our Control” means any act or event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation any act of God, strikes, lockouts or other industrial action by third parties, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic or other natural disaster, failure of public or private telecommunications or power networks, equipment failure, system failure, material change to Law, or change in industry self-regulation regarding Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining or associated services.</dt><br>
<dt><b>14.2.</b> <u>Our Liability</u>. We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations to deliver the Services that is caused by an Event Outside Our Control.</dt><br>
<dt><b>14.3.</b> <u>Effect</u>. If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations to deliver Services, (a) we will contact you as soon as reasonably possible to notify you; and (b) our obligations to you will be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control. Where the Event Outside Our Control affects our delivery of Services to you for a period of greater than six months (an “Extended Event Outside Our Control”) we shall have sole discretion to cease provision of the Services to you.</dt><br>
<dt><b>14.4.</b> <u>Allocation</u>. We are also entitled, during Events Outside Our Control, to allocate the disruption or harm across a number of affected Users or Services. You acknowledge that this may reduce your allocated Services and the Customer Portion which is distributed to you.</dt><br>
<dt><b>14.5.</b> <u>Regulation</u>. We have the right to redeem the current active mining contracts at the current one-time allocation price in order to avoid disputes in connection with entry into force the goverment regulation (if any) of the Services with 7 days' notice via internal email.</dt><br>
</dl>
<li>HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES ABOUT THE SERVICES?</li>
<dl>
<dt><b>15.1.</b> <u>General</u>. YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER, CONCERNING, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SERVICES), ITS INTERPRETATION, ITS VALIDITY (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT IS VOID OR VOIDABLE), ITS TERMINATION, OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, THE MARKETING OR PURCHASE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, WHETHER THEY ARE WITH US OR ANY OF OUR SUPPLIERS (TO THE EXTENT NOT WAIVED, AS SET FORTH ABOVE) ONLY BY MANDATORY, FINAL, BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY, SINCE THERE IS NONE IN ARBITRATION. IN ARBITRATION, THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IN COURT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. YOU AGREE THAT IN SOME CASES, THE LAW PERMITS THE PREVAILING PARTY TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ITS ATTORNEYS FEES, AND THE SAME APPLIES TO DISPUTES THAT YOU RAISE IN ARBITRATION.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.2.</b> <u>Arbitration of Disputes</u>. Any controversy, claim, or dispute (“Dispute”) arising under, concerning, or relating to this Agreement (including any Services), its interpretation, its validity (including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable), its termination, or its subject matter, the marketing or purchase of the Service or any use or inability to use the Service, whether the Dispute is with us or any or any Supplier (to the extent not waived, as set forth above), whether the Dispute is for breach of contract, tort, or any other matter can only be resolved or adjudicated only by mandatory, final, binding arbitration.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.3.</b> <u>Raising a Dispute</u>. To raise a Dispute, you must give us notice of the Dispute by sending an e-mail to <a href='mailto:support@hashing24.com'>support@hashing24.com</a> with the words “RAISING A DISPUTE” in the subject line), along with a written description of your Dispute, including any documents and information that you believe will help us understand your Dispute, and your requested resolution. In order to discuss the Dispute with you, you permit us (or the Disputed party) to contact you by phone, text message, email or physical mail through any and all addresses or phone numbers that you have provided. You must send us notice of any Dispute within 30 days of your discovering the act or omission that gave rise to your Dispute. If you do not so notify us, then you lose your right to raise the Dispute.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.4.</b> <u>Resolution Offer</u>. Within the first 30 days of your submitting your Dispute, we will have the right, but no obligation, to provide you with a proposed resolution of the Dispute (the “Offer”). If you are unsatisfied with the Offer, you must reject the Offer by notice to us within 14 days of the Offer. If you do not reject the Offer within at 14-day period, you will be deemed to have accepted it and forfeit your right to raise the Dispute. If we do not make the Offer within 30 days of your submitting your Dispute or if you reject an Offer as set forth above, either you or we may commence arbitration of the Dispute as set forth below.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.5.</b> <u>Place and Language</u>. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the English language, in the UK. We shall choose the arbitration service to be used for the Dispute.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.6.</b> <u>Award</u>. Any award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the award. Judgment upon an award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator must be based upon this Agreement and applicable Law. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding except for fraud, misconduct, or errors of law, and judgment upon the decision rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.7.</b> <u>Waiver of Rights</u>.</dt><br>
<dt>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE. IT PROVIDES THAT YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THROUGH ARBITRATION, EVEN IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHTS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR MAY BE MORE LIMITED. YOU SHOULD CONSULT LEGAL COUNSEL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.</dt><br>
<dt>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY (EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE ARBITRATION RULES), AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES. YOU ALSO AGREE ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY AND WILL NOT BE PART OF A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.</dt><br>
<dt><b>15.8.</b> <u>NO CLASS ACTIONS</u>. EVEN IF APPLICABLE LAW, OR THE ARBITRATOR OTHERWISE PERMITS CLASS ACTIONS OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS, THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SPECIFIED HERE APPLIES AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS – THAT IS – TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</dt><br>

</dl>
<li>OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS</li>
<dl>
<dt><b>16.1.</b> <u>Governing Law</u>. English laws will govern any disputes relating to the Service or these Terms, notwithstanding the English conflicts of laws rules or any other jurisdiction.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.2.</b> <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement (including any Services) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of us which is not set out in this Agreement.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.3.</b> <u>Our Assignment</u>. We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under this Agreement or a Service to another entity, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Agreement or the terms of the Service. We will endeavor to notify you in writing if this happens.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.4.</b> <u>Your Assignment.</u> A Service is between you and us, and you may not assign, transfer, sublease, encumber or subject to any security interest a Service without written authorization from us. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void and of no effect.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.5.</b> <u>Third Party Beneficiaries</u>. No other person, other than you, shall have any rights to enforce this Agreement or a Service, whether under the Contracts or otherwise.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.6.</b> <u>Severability</u>. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, including without limitation anything regarding the arbitration process, such provision will be struck from this Agreement only to the extent it is invalid or unenforceable. Unless otherwise provided, all other terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.7.</b> <u>Waiver</u>. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.8.</b> <u>Conflict</u>. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and something stated by any Other Entity, whether before or after you enter into this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.</dt><br>
<dt><b>16.9.</b> <u>Survival</u>. Any terms of this Agreement which by their nature should survive will survive the termination of this Agreement.</dt><br>
